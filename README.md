This completes the first part of the registration process and the rest will happen during onboarding.
  
  
In onboarding the user will be asked a series of questions to set up their profile. This can be changed later on but all fields are   required to complete the profile and get to the dashboard.  
  


Simply fill out the information that is being asked and press the arrow when complete. Once all steps are filled out you are done and   will be taken to the dashboard.  
  

**Dashboard**  
When on the dashboard a user can swipe left or right on a card to either like or pass on another profile. The user is also given the   option to log out of their profile and return to the home screen.

On the bottom of the page there are 3 navigation icons. The center will bring you to the main page of the dashboard where the card stack is located. On the right hand side there is a button to edit your profile.  

The user can choose to edit any part of their profile at any time. Once finished press the save button and your profile has been updated.  

The third icon is for the chat which has not yet been implemented. This is where the new matched profiles as well as any previous chats started with older matches.
